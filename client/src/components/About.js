                Hi, my name is Bijan Parsiyar Web Engineer, Investor and Avid
                Learner I'm currently working remote as Web Engineer for
                Responsival in Plano, Texas. My primary focus is front-end
                technologies such as ReactJs while expanding my knowledge in
                testing and back end development utilizing NodeJs. I'm currently
                looking to expand my horizons as a freelance web developer.

                So are you looking for a professional, communicative & punctual
                software engineer with extensive full-stack web development
                skills for your next project? <br />
                <hr />
                If you have an application you are interested in developing with
                web technology, I'd love to work with you on it. I'm a
                full-stack developer with means I can bring your project from
                <strong> concept to completion</strong>. I work primarily with
                <u> Node.js</u> on the back-end and <u> React.js</u> on the
                front-end but picking up new languages or frameworks isn't a
                problem.
